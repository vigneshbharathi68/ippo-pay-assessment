### Password Strength Validation and Storage in MongoDB
This project involves implementing password strength validation using React.js for the front-end and Node.js (Express.js) for the back-end. The validated passwords will be stored in MongoDB. Additionally, the deployment platform used is Render.

#### Project Structure
```
./front-end/             # React.js app directory
./server/                # Node.js (Express.js) app directory
./password-validation.js # Password strength validation solution file
./num-partition.js       # Number Partition least sum solution file
```

#### React project run instruction
To run the react.js locally, follow these steps:
1. Navigate to the front-end directory:
```
cd front-end
```
2. Install the required dependencies:
```
npm install
```
3. Start the development server:
```
npm run start
```
The React app should now be running on http://localhost:3000.

Express Js project deployed in `render` and running in `https://nodejs-rest-api-byno.onrender.com`

#### Password Strength Validation and Storage Solution
The password strength validation and storage solution can be found in the password-validation.js file.

#### Number Partition Least Sum Solution
The solution for the Number Partition least sum problem can be found in the num-partition.js file.
